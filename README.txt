This build script should work for OSX and Windows
Pull this repository and load the contents into your JavaScript package. 
On OSX, you'll have to make the jsl file executable (chmod +x ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/JavaScript/jsl/osx/jsl).
To run a build, press F7 on Windows or Command+B on OSX (You may have to choose the correct Build System in Tools -> Build system the first time you use the plugin)
To jump to lines after completing a build, press F4 on Windows (not sure of the OSX command)
Shift+F4 (win) will traverse the lines backwards.
